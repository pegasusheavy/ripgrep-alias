# ripgrep-alias

> A lightweight wrapper that makes ripgrep handle GNU grep's -E (--extended-regexp) flag correctly.

ripgrep-alias is a drop-in shell wrapper for ripgrep (rg). It solves a common pain point for developers switching from GNU grep to ripgrep: the -E flag means completely different things in each tool.

- In GNU grep, -E enables Extended Regular Expressions (ERE), equivalent to egrep.
- In ripgrep, -E is short for --encoding, which specifies input file encoding.

Since ripgrep already uses ERE-equivalent regex syntax by default, ripgrep-alias simply strips -E and --extended-regexp from the argument list before forwarding to the real rg binary. The overhead is negligible.

## Install

Shell (bash, zsh, dash, POSIX sh):

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pegasusheavy/ripgrep-alias/main/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell (5.1+, Core 7+):

```
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pegasusheavy/ripgrep-alias/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer downloads the wrapper to ~/.local/share/ripgrep-alias/ and adds a source line to your shell profile.

## How it works

The wrapper defines a shell function named `rg` that:
1. Iterates through the argument list
2. Removes -E and --extended-regexp arguments
3. Passes all remaining arguments to `command rg` (the real ripgrep binary)

If you need ripgrep's native encoding flag, use the long form --encoding instead.

## FAQ

Q: Does ripgrep-alias slow down ripgrep?
A: No. It adds a few microseconds of shell processing before calling rg.

Q: Can I still use ripgrep's encoding flag?
A: Yes. Use --encoding instead of -E. Example: rg --encoding utf-8 'pattern' file.

Q: Which shells are supported?
A: rg.sh works with any POSIX-compatible shell (bash, zsh, dash, ash). rg.ps1 works with PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell Core 7+.

Q: Does it handle combined flags like -iE?
A: It handles -E and --extended-regexp as standalone arguments. Use -i -E instead of -iE.

Q: How do I uninstall?
A: Remove the source line from your shell profile and delete ~/.local/share/ripgrep-alias/.
